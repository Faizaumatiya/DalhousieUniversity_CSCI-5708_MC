====================================
1. I created 2 class namely FirstFragment.java and SecondFragment.java
2. FirstFragment.java - It takes the password details from the user and transfer it to the second Fragment by clicking on the  "Go to next fragment" button.
3. SecondFragment.java - It accepts the password from the user and display it on the screen. If the password entered is empty then it will display "no secret". If user clicks on "Go Back" button it should move to the first Fragment.
4. Main.java - Builds the connection between the first and second Fragments. Where the data can be pass between those fragments.
5. Interface PassData - helps to transfer the data (password) between the  2 fragments.
